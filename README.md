#  Project Overview

This project simulates a **Risk Modeling** machine learning use case:
Classifying a text as **Spam** or **Ham** based on pre-trained models.

- **Backend:** FastAPI service for prediction, explanation (SHAP), and validation.
- **Frontend:** Streamlit UI for easy interaction.
- **Models:** XGBoost and Logistic Regression trained on SMS Spam Dataset.

---

#  Features

- Predict Spam vs Ham.
- SHAP-based feature importance visualized using Plotly Beeswarm Plot.
- Great Expectations used for input validation.
- OpenAPI Schema (Data Contract) exported.
- Deployed using Docker and Google Cloud Run.

---

#  Prediction Task

- **Task:** Spam Detection (Risk Modeling)
- **Models:** XGBoost and Logistic Regression
- **Dataset:** Public Kaggle SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- **Preprocessing:**
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Metrics Evaluated:**
  - F1-Score
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - ROC-AUC
  - Brier Score

#  API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| GET   | `/`         | Home Route |
| POST  | `/validate` | Validate Input Message |
| POST  | `/predict`  | Predict Spam or Ham |
| POST  | `/explain`  | SHAP Explainability |

Example Request to `/predict`:
```json
{
  "model_choice": "XGBoost",
  "text": "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 Walmart gift card."
}
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "prediction": "spam",
  "probability": 98.76
}
```

#  Deployment Overview

- **Dockerized** both Backend and Frontend separately.
- **Deployed** using **Google Cloud Run**.
- Used **Docker Buildx** for correct architecture (`linux/amd64`).
- Pushed container images to Google Container Registry.
